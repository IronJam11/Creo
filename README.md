## Introduction

**Creo** is a blockchain-backed platform that makes open-source collaboration **trustless, fair, and secure**. It combines a **two-sided staking protocol** (repo owners + issue solvers) with **verifiable AI agents** and **Celo zk-based user verification** to prevent collusion, overruns, Sybil attacks, and human impersonation.

The result: predictable incentives, protected contributors (especially newbies), and verified AI assistance — all enforced via smart contracts and verifiable identity proofs.

## The Problem

* **Collusion / code appropriation:** Repo maintainers could view PRs and copy code without merging or rewarding the contributor.
* **Overruns & incentive misalignment:** Experienced contributors can unintentionally overrun newcomers’ PRs, causing unfair rewards.
* **Centralized trust dependency:** Platforms like Gitcoin rely on maintainers manually releasing funds.
* **Fake accounts / Sybil attacks:** Multiple fake accounts can distort rewards or spam the system.
* **Unverified human contribution:** Without identity verification, it’s impossible to ensure contributions are made by legitimate humans.

## High-level solution

Creo enforces fairness and security by combining:

1. **Two-sided staking** — both repo owners and solvers stake tokens; stakes are returned or slashed depending on verifiable conditions.
2. **Smart contract ↔ GitHub API reconciliation** — each issue is represented as a contract struct and continuously matched to live GitHub metadata to detect off-platform merges or abuse.
3. **Verifiable AI + reputation** — AI agents assist with code analysis and PR review. Their computations are auditable, and their reputation is maintained on-chain.
4. **Celo zk-based identity verification** — each user is verified via zero-knowledge proofs; a nullifier is mapped to each address to prevent duplicate accounts and ensure human contribution.

## How staking works

### Why project owners stake

* **Prevent collusion / copying:** Owners cannot safely bypass contributor PRs; stake remains locked until all issues are resolved on-platform.
* **Prevent unauthorized merges:** Only assigned contributors can have their PRs merged. Any mismatch triggers stake slashing.
* **Align incentives:** Owners are economically motivated to follow Creo’s flow, ensuring fairness.

### Why solvers (issue assignees) stake

* **Sybil resistance & DoS protection:** Staking prevents spam or mass fake registrations.
* **Exclusive rights & deadlines:** Stakers gain exclusive assignment with a defined deadline. Missed deadlines reopen issues for others but do not penalize the staker.
* **Beginner protection:** Unstaked overruns are ineligible for rewards, ensuring newcomers are not sidelined.
* **Verified identity:** zk-based verification ensures contributions come from legitimate human participants.

## Release / slashing rules

* Each issue is a smart contract struct with metadata and status.
* Owner stake is returned only when the contract confirms the issue array is fully resolved.
* Off-platform merges, unauthorized actions, or rule violations trigger slashing or redistribution of stakes per protocol rules.

---

## Verifiable AI approach

* **Proofed computation:** AI agents produce auditable outputs.
* **Reputation & accountability:** Agent identities and performance scores are recorded on-chain. Malicious agents lose priority and credibility.
* **Multi-agent analysis:** PRs and repos are reviewed by multiple ASI agents, synthesizing a robust and verifiable recommendation.

---

## Why Creo is better than traditional platforms

* **Automated fairness:** No reliance on maintainers to release funds.
* **Beginner protection:** Staked deadlines protect newcomers.
* **Verified contributions:** zk-proof identity verification ensures all contributors are real humans.
* **Sybil & DoS resistance:** Contributor staking and nullifier checks prevent abuse.
* **Verifiable AI:** Transparent, auditable AI assistance reduces bias and centralization risks.

## Tech Stack

* **Blockchain:** Celo Mainnet (smart contracts enforce staking, issue management, AI credit allocation).
* **Identity verification:** Celo’s zk-based self-verification + nullifiers mapped to addresses.
* **AI agents:** ASI-based distributed agents for intelligent code analysis, PR review, and recommendation synthesis.
* **GitHub integration:** Continuous reconciliation of contract state with GitHub metadata.
